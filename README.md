## Motivation

We noticed that most pixel art tools are either locked behind paywalls or seem to do everything except pixel art. So, we created ZIDE: an open-source, easy-to-use pixel art app that just works!

## Features

### Pixel Free Draw

You can `draw`, `fill` and `erase` with the built-in tools

### Panning and Zooming

You can `zoom` or `pan` through the edit space

### Animation

You can create multiple frames into 2d-motion

### Render

You can render the drawing as the sprite sheet

## Installation

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (required for Tauri CLI)
